# Backend for Real-time Messaging üì°

![Backend Logo](https://link-to-your-backend-logo.png)

## üìå Overview

This backend is a powerhouse crafted with **Go** (Golang), utilizing the **gRPC** framework and **Protocol Buffers** (protobuf) to serve the frontend with lightning-fast real-time data. Through gRPC's capabilities, it ensures high-speed communication, making it perfect for our real-time messaging system.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```plaintext
/backend
|-- /proto
|   |-- messages.proto
|   |-- services.proto
|-- /db
|   |-- setup.go
|-- /handlers
|   |-- auth.go
|   |-- chat.go
|-- main.go
|-- README.md
```

### Directory Breakdown:

- `/proto`: Contains the Protocol Buffers definitions which outline the structure of our data and service methods.
  - `messages.proto`: Definitions related to the structure of our messages.
  - `services.proto`: Service methods for chat and user authentication.
  
- `/db`: Contains scripts and logic related to database operations.
  - `setup.go`: Setup and connection logic for our PostgreSQL database.
  
- `/handlers`: Go handlers for handling different routes and gRPC calls.
  - `auth.go`: Handles user registration and authentication.
  - `chat.go`: Handles sending and receiving messages.
  
- `main.go`: The entry point of our backend application.

## üî© Technologies & Frameworks

- **Go (Golang)**: The primary language for our backend, known for its speed and efficiency.
- ![gRPC Icon](https://link-to-grpc-icon.png) **gRPC**: A high-performance, universal RPC framework.
- ![Protocol Buffers Icon](https://link-to-protobuf-icon.png) **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)**: A method developed by Google to serialize structured data, working hand-in-hand with gRPC.

## üöÄ Core Features

1. **gRPC for Communication**: Utilizes gRPC for server-client communication, providing an efficient, lightweight, and language-agnostic method for data transport.
2. **Protocol Buffers for Data Definition**: Uses protobuf for defining both the message format and the service methods, offering a clear contract between the server and client.
3. **Real-time Messaging Logic**: Through gRPC streaming, messages are instantly transported between users in real-time.
4. **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with PostgreSQL, storing user data and messages.

## üö¢ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (for the backend server)
- gRPC
protoc --go_out=. --proto_path=. logic.proto


- Protocol Buffers
- PostgreSQL (for the database)

### Setting Up

1. **Backend**:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd path-to-your-go-backend

    # Set up the environment variables for database
    export DB_HOST=localhost
    export DB_PORT=5432
    export DB_USER=postgres
    export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    export DB_NAME=your_database_name

    # Run the Go application
    go run main.go
    ```
